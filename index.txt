web components enable developers to write their app in a more modular ways by creating custom components

building blocks
 - Custom HTML - allow user to create new html tag
    - create a class extending from HTMLElement
    - register the class with the browser
 - HTML Templates - a break apart of the html. They don't get rendered on load but can be loaded with JavaScript at runtime 
 - Shadow DOM - allow user to encapsulate the dom of a web component making it self contained.
